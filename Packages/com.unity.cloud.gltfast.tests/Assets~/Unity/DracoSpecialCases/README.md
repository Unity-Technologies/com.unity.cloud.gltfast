# Draco Special Cases

## Description

Derivative of *Eight Texcoords* that covers a couple of corner cases in context of Draco mesh compression:

- 8 texture coordinates.
- Missing mesh bounds (min/max property of positions accessor), forcing importer to falling back calculating them.
- Does not come with tangents, but uses a normal map, forcing the importer to calculate tangents.
