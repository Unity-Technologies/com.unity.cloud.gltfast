# No Normals

## Description

Contains a single mesh with position and texture coordinate attributes only. The material has a normal map, so according to the glTF 2.0 specification flat normals and tangents need to be calculated. The mesh is a 4-sided cylinder without top/bottom caps with 10 vertices. In order to have individual normals per face, shared vertices have to be duplicated, resulting in 16 vertices total.
