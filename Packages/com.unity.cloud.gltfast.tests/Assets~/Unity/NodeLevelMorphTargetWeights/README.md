# Node Level Morph Target Weights

## Description

Contains a single triangle mesh with two morph targets. One makes it point to the red sphere, the other to the green sphere. The default morph target weights on the mesh primitive make it point to the red sphere (used in scene 1 "MeshLevel"). The weights on node at index 0 make it point to the green sphere (used in default scene 0 "NodeLevel").
